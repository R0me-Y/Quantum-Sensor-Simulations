# Quantum Sensor Simulation

This repository will contain simulations and models related to quantum entanglement and sensing systems â€” especially with potential satellite and aerospace applications.

ðŸš§ **Status:**  
Currently in the **theoretical learning phase**, focusing on mastering:
- Quantum mechanics foundations (via MIT 8.04)
- Entanglement theory (via Susskind's Stanford lectures)
- Mathematical groundwork from Shankar, J.J Sakurai & Gasiorowicz

ðŸ“ˆ **Upcoming Work (by July 1):**
- Entangled two-qubit simulations (Bell states and CHSH inequality)
- Measurement outcome visualizations & quantum correlations
- Draft models of qubit-based sensor architectures for space environments
- Literature review: *Quantum Sensors â€” Applications and Challenges in Space*

ðŸ§  **Vision:**  
To build open, pedagogical quantum sensing simulations for use in quantum research and aerospace technology.

ðŸ’¬ **Note:**  
The simulation code will begin development after relative concept mastery is achieved, expected by **July 1**.
