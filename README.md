# Quantum Sensor Simulation

This repository will contain simulations and models related to quantum entanglement and sensing systems â€” especially with potential satellite and aerospace applications.

ðŸš§ **Status:**  
Currently in the **theoretical learning phase**, focusing on mastering:
- Quantum mechanics foundations (via MIT 8.04)
- Entanglement theory (via Susskind's Stanford lectures)
- Mathematical groundwork from Shankar, J.J Sakurai & Gasiorowicz

ðŸ§  **Upcoming:**
- Simulation of entangled two-particle systems (Bell states)
- Measurement outcomes and CHSH inequality experiments
- Sensor model drafts based on qubit measurement strategies

ðŸ’¬ **Note:**  
The simulation code will begin development after relative concept mastery is achieved, expected by **July 1**. This ensures depth, rigor, and clarity in the models created.
